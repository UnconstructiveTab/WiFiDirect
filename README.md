# WiFiDirect
A small executable that creates a WiFi Direct hotspot with a specific SSID and password.

The code in this is unbeleiveably terrible, but it somehow works.

It should compile as a normal project, and I am adding a release copy of an exe to test with.

In the same directory of the EXE there should be two files (without extension), `ssid` and `pass`. Fill each respectivly with a valid SSID and password. Once the executable is run, it will start up the point with the specified info.
